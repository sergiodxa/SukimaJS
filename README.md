[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

A schema creator and validator.

## Install
Use NPM to install with the command:

```
npm i -S sukimajs
```

## How to use
Import SukimaJS inside your JS file using:

```javascript
var sukimajs = require('sukimajs');
```

Create your Schema:

```javascript
var User = sukimajs.register({
  name : 'alphanumeric',
  pass : 'base64',
  email: 'email'
});
```

Validate data using the validate method:

```javascript
var data = {
  name: 'sukima',
  pass: 'cGFzc3dvcmQqMTIz',
  email: 'sukima@gmail.com'
}
var valid = User.validate(data);
```

If the data are valid the valid variable will be true, else the variable valid will be an array of errors.

If you want to use it in browser just compile it using Browserify to create a browser compatible JS file.
